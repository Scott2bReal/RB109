```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

new_array = arr.select do |n| 
  n + 1
end

p new_array
```
This code outputs `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and returns that same array.
It does so because on `line 7`, the `p` method is called and passed the argument
`new_array`, which is a local variable which was initialized on `line 3`, and
assigned the return value of the `select` method being called on local variable
`arr`, which was initialized on `line 1` and assigned to the `Array` object
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. When `select` is called on this object, it is
passed a `do..end` block as an argument with the parameter `n`. The statement in
on `line 4`, in the body of the block, will always return `true`, so the new
array returned by `select` will contain every element of the array on which it
is called.
