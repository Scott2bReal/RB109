```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

incremented = arr.map do |n| 
            n + 1
            end

p incremented
```

This code will output and return `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`

On `line 1` the local variable `arr` is initialized and assigned to the `Array`
object `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

On `line 3` the local variable `incremented` is initialized and assigned to the
return value of the `map` method being called on `arr`. The `map` method is
passed a `do..end` block as an argument with one block parameter `n`

Inside of the `do..end` block, on `line 4`, the expression `n + 1` will be
evaluated for each element of `arr`, and `map` will use the implicit return
value of that expression to populate a new `Array` object, and `map` will return
that object.

The `p` method which is called on `line 7` and passed `incremented` as an
argument will output and return the `Array` object to which `incremented` is
assigned.
