```
def fix(value)
  value[1] = 'x'
  value 
 end

s = 'abc'
t = fix(s)

p s
p t
```

This code will output:

```
"axc"
"axc"
```

and will return the `String` object `"axc"`

On `line 6` the local variable `s` is initialized and assigned to the `String`
object `"abc"`

On `line 7` the local variable `t` is initialized and assigned to the return
value of the `fix` method being called with `s` passed in as an argument. The
`fix` method is defined on `lines 1-4` with one parameter, `value` 

Inside of the `fix` method definition, on `line 2` the `[]=` method is called on
`value`. This mutates the caller, so the `String` object to which `value` is
assigned is now `"axc"`. The local variable `s` in the main scope is also
assigned to this same `String` object.

Due to implicit return in Ruby, the statement of the local variable `value` on
`line 3` is responsible for the return value of the `fix` method.

On `lines 9-10` the `p` method is called on `s` and `t`, respectively. Because
`s` and `t` are assigned to the same `String` object, both of these method
calls will output and return `"axc"`
