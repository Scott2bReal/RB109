```
arr1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
arr2 = arr1.dup
arr2.map! do |char|
  char.upcase
end

puts arr1 
puts arr2
```

This code will output:

```
a
b
c
A
B
C
```

and return `nil`

On `lines 1 and 2` local variables `arr1` and `arr2` are initialized, with
`arr1` being assigned to the `Array` object `['a', 'b', 'c']` and `arr2` being
assigned to the return value of the `dup` method being called on `arr1`. `dup`
creates a shallow copy of the `Array` object assigned to `arr1`.

On `line 3` the `map!` method is called on `arr2` and passed a `do..end` block
as an argument with one block parameter `char`. The `map!` method mutates the
caller. 

Inside the `do..end` block, on `line 4` the `upcase` method is called on `char`.
`map!` uses the return value of this block to modify the calling `Array` object.

Because `dup` creates a shallow copy, the `Array` object assigned to `arr1` is
not modified by `map!`.

Therefore, `arr1` remains unchanged, while `arr2` is now assigned to the `Array`
object `['A', 'B', 'C']`

The `puts` method calls on `lines 8-9` will both return `nil`, and will output
the `Array` objects passed as arguments
