```
num = 3

num = 2 * num

p num
```

This code will output and return the `Integer` object `6`

On `line 1` the local variable `num` is assigned to the `Integer` object `3`

on `line 3` the local variable `num` is reassigned to the return value of the
expression `2 * num`, which is `6`

On `line 5` the `p` method is called and passed `num` as an argument. This
outputs and returns the `Integer` object assigned to `num`, `6`.
