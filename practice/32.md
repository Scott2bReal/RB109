```ruby
hash = { a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }

new_hash = hash.each_with_object({}) do |(key, value), hash|
  hash[value] = key
end

p hash
p new_hash
```

This code will output:

```
{:a=>"ant", :b=>"bear", :c=>"cat"}
{"ant"=>:a, "bear"=>:b, "cat"=>:c}
```

and will return `{"ant"=>:a, "bear"=>:b, "cat"=>:c}`

On `line 1` the local variable `hash` is initialized and assigned to the `Hash`
object `{:a=>"ant", :b=>"bear", :c=>"cat"}`

On `line 3` the local variable `new_hash` is initialized and assigned to the
return value of the `each_with_object` method being called on `hash`.
`each_with_object` is passed an empty `Hash` object (`{}`) as an argument along
with a `do..end` block with two block parameters `(key, value)` and `hash`

Inside of the block, the `[]=` method is called on `hash` and passed `value` and
`key` as arguments. The local variable `hash` in this case is shadowing the
`hash` variable initialized in the outer scope. Therefore, the `Hash` object to
which `hash` is assigned in the outer scope is unavailable within the block.
