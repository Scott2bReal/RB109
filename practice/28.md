```ruby
new_arr = [1, 2, 3].all? do |num|
  num > 2
end

p new_arr
```

This code will output and return `false`

On `line 1` local variable `new_arr` is initialized and assigned to the return
value of the `all?` method being called on the `Array` object `[1, 2, 3]`. The
`all?` method is passed a `do..end` block with one block parameter `num`.

Inside the block the `Integer` object to which `num` is assigned is compared to
the `Integer` object `2`. If `num` is greater than `2` then `true` will be
returned by the block due to implicit return in Ruby. If `num` is less than or
equal to `2`, the block will return `false`. If at any point the block returns
`false`, `new_arr` will be assigned to `false`.

Because the expression `1 > 2` evaluates to `false`, this will be the ultimate
return value of the `all?` method call on `line 1`. Therefore,  the `p` method
call with `new_arr` passed to it as an argument on `line 4` will output and
return `false`
