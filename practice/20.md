```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

p arr.each { |n| puts n }
```

This code will output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

and will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

On `line 1` local variable `arr` is initialized and assigned to the `Array`
object `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

On `line 3`, the `p` method is called and is passed as an argument the return
value of the `each` method called on `arr`. `each` always returns the object on
which it is called, so this is what `p` outputs and returns. 

However, `each` will execute the block that is passed to it as an argument (with
one block parameter `n`) for every element of `arr`. Inside this block, the
`puts` method is called and passed `n` as an argument. `puts` will output the
element of `arr` currently assigned to `n` and will return `nil`, although this
return value is never used in this code. These outputs will come before the
output of the `p` method call.
