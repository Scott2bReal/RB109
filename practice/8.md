```
def fix(value)
  value << 'xyz'
  value = value.upcase
  value.concat('!')
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)

p s
p t
```

This code will output:

```
"helloxyz"
"HELLOXYZ!"
```

and will return `"HELLOXYZ!"`

On `line 7` local variable `s` is initialized and assigned to the `String`
object `"hello"`.

On `line 8` local variable `t` is initialized and assigned to the return value
of the `fix` method being called with `s` passed in as an argument. The `fix`
method is defined on `lines 1-5` with one parameter `value`

Inside of the `fix` method definition, on `line 2` the `String` object is
shoveled (`<<`) into `value`. The shovel operator modifies the caller, so the
`String` object assigned to `s` in the outer scope is affected.

On `line 3`, the local variable `value` is reassigned to the return value of the
`upcase` method being called on itself. Because this creates a new `String`
object, the `String` object assigned to `s` in the `main` scope is not affected.

On `line 4`, the `concat` method is called on `value` with the `String` object
`"!"` passed in as an argument. This returns a new `String` object, which is
also the ultimate return value of the `fix` method due to the concept of
implicit return in Ruby. As a result, `t` is assigned to the `String` object 
`"HELLOXYZ!"` in the `main` scope

Therefore, on `line 10` when the `p` method is called and passed `s` as an
argument, `"helloxyz"` is output and returned

On `line 11` when the `p` method is called and passed `t` as an argument,
`"HELLOXYZ!"` is output and returned. Because this is the last line of code
evaluated, this is also the ultimate return value of the program
