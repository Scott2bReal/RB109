```
def add_name(arr, name)
  arr = arr << name
end

names = ['bob', 'kim']
add_name(names, 'jim')
puts names
```

This code will output:

```
bob
kim
james
```

and will return `nil`

On `line 5` local variable `names` is initialized and assigned to the `Array`
object `['bob', 'kim']`.

On `line 6` the `add_name` method is called and passed `names` and the `String`
object `'jim'` as arguments. The `add_name` method is defined on `lines 1-3`
with two parameters, `arr` and `name`

Inside of the `add_name` method definition, local variable `arr` is reassigned
to the return value of the `<<` method being called on `arr` with `name` passed
in as an argument. The reassignment in this case is unecessary, because the
shovel operater mutates the caller.

The return value of the `add_name` method call on `line 6` is therefore the
`Array` object `['bob', 'kim', 'james']`, but is unused.

On `line 7` the `puts` method is called with `names` passed in as an argument.
This outputs each element of the `names` array and returns `nil`
