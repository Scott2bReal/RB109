```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

new_array = arr.map do |n| 
  n > 1
end

p new_array
```

This code will output and return 

`[false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true]`

On `line 1` local variable `arr` is initialized and assigned to the `Array`
object `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

On `line 3` local variable `new_array` is initialized and assigned to the return
value of the `map` method being called on `arr`. The `map` method is passed a
`do..end` block with one block parameter `n`.

Inside of this block, the expression on `line 4` will be evaluated for every
element of `arr`. `map` will use the return value of that expression to populate
a new `Array` object because it is the last line evaluated in the block, so the
block ultimately returns that value due to implicit return in Ruby.

Because the expression `n > 1` will evaluate to `true` for every element of `arr`
except for `1`, every element of the `Array` object returned by `map` will be
`true` except the first, which will be `false`

This `Array` object is what is output and returned when the `p` method is called
with `new_array` passed in as an argument on `line 7`
