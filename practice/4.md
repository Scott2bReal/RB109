```
a = [1, 3]
b = [2]
arr = [a, b]
arr

a[1] = 5
arr
```

This code will have no output and will ultimately return `[[1, 5], [2]]`

On `lines 1-2` local variables `a` and `b` are initialized and assigned the
`Array` objects `[1, 3]` and `[2]`, respectively.

On `line 3` local variable `arr` is initialized and assigned to the `Array`
object `[a, b]`.

On `line 4`, local variable `arr` is pointing to the `Array` object 
`[[1, 3], [2]]`.

On `line 6`, the `[]=` method is called on `a` with the `Integer` object `5`
passed in as an argument. This mutates the caller, and will modify the `Array`
object assigned to `a` to be `[1, 5]`.

On `line 7`, the local variable `arr` is still pointing to the same `Array`
object `[a, b]`. Because the object assigned to `a` was modified, that change is
reflected in the `Array` object assigned to `arr`

Due to implicit return in Ruby, `line 8` is responsible for the ultimate return
value of the code, `[[1, 5], [2]]`
