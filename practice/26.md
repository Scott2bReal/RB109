```ruby
a = "hello"

new_arr = [1, 2, 3].map { |num| a }

p new_arr

```

This code will output and return `["hello", "hello", "hello"]`

On `line 1` local variable `a` is initialized and assigned to the `String`
object `"hello"`

On `line 3`, local variable `new_arr` is initialized and assigned to the return
value of the `map` method being called on the `Array` object `[1, 2, 3]`. The
`map` method is passed a block as an argument with one block parameter, `num`

Inside of the block, the `String` object to which local variable `a` is assigned
is implicitly returned. `map` uses this return value to populate the new array
being assigned to `new_arr`. Local variable `a` is accessible within the block
because it was initialized in an outer scope

On `line 5` the `p` method is passed `new_arr` as an argument, and will output
and return the `Array` object to which it `new_arr` was assigned
