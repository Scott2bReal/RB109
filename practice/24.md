```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

new_array = arr.map do |n| 
  n > 1
  puts n
end

p new_array
```

This code will output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
[nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil]
```

and will return `[nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil]`

On `line 1` local variable `arr` is initialized and assigned to the `Array`
object `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

On `line 3` local variable `new_array` is initialized and assigned to the return
value of the `map` method being called on `arr`. The `map` method is passed a
`do..end` block as an argument with one block parameter, `n`

Inside of this block, the statement on `line 4` is irrelevant as its return
value is never used. The `puts` method call on `line 5` with `n` passed as an
argument will output the element of `arr` currently assigned to `n` and will
output `nil`. `map` will populate and return a new `Array` object using the
return value of that `puts` method call due to implicit return in Ruby, where
the last evaluated expression is automatically returned.

The `p` method call will output and return that `Array` object when passed
`new_array` as an argument, as that is what `new_array` has been assigned to
