```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

new_arr = arr.select { |n| n.odd? }

p new_arr
```

This code will output and return `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`

On `line 1` local variable `arr` is initialized and assigned to the `Array`
object `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

On `line 3` the local variable `new_arr` is initialized and assigned to the
return value of the `select` method being called on `arr`. The `select` method
is passed a `do..end` block as an argument, with one block parameter `n`.
`select` will execute this block for every element of the `Array` object
assigned to `arr`, and use the return value of the block to populate a new
`Array` object.

Inside the `do..end` block, the `odd?` method is called on local variable `n`.
This method call will return a `boolean`, and `select` will use that return
value to populate a new array with only the elements of `arr` for which the
`odd?` method call returns `true`

Therefore, on `line 5` when `p` is called and passed `new_arr` as an argument,
the output and return will be as stated above
