```
def fix(value)
  value.upcase!
  value.concat('!')
  value
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)

p s
p t
```

This code will output:

```
"HELLO!"
"HELLO!"
```

and return `"HELLO!"`

On `lines 7-8` local variables `s` and `t` are initialized and assigned to,
respectively, the `String` object `"hello"`, and the return value of the `fix`
method being called with `s` passed as an argument. The `fix` method is defined
on `lines 1-5` with one block parameter `value`

Inside of this method definition, on `line 2`, the `upcase!` method is called on
`value`. `upcase!` mutates the calling object.

On `line 3`, the `concat` method is called on `value` and is passed as an
argument the `String` object `"!"`. The `concat` method also mutates the caller.

On `line 4`, the statement of local variable `value` will cause the method to
implicitly return the `String` object assigned to `value`, which in this case is
`"HELLO!"`

Therefore, `s` and `t` are still pointing to the same, modified, `String` object
`"HELLO!"`. This will be output twice due to the `p` method being called with
`s` and `t` on `lines 7 and 8`, respectively.

The `p` call on the final line of the program (`line 8`) is responsible for the
ultimate return value of the code
