```ruby
a = "hello"

new_arr = [1, 2, 3].map { |num| a }

p new_arr
```

This code will output and return `["hello", "hello", "hello"]`

On `line 1` local variable `a` is initialized and assigned to the `String`
object `"hello"`

On `line 3` local variable `new_arr` is initialized and assigned to the return
value of the `map` method being called on the `Array` object `[1, 2, 3]`. The
`map` method is passed a block as an argument, with one block parameter `num`

The `map` method will execute this block for each element of the `Array` method
on which it was called. It will populate a new `Array` object with the return
value of this block.

The block will return the `String` object `"hello"` every time due to implicit
return in Ruby (the last evaluated expression in a block, method definition or
program is returned).

Therefore, the `new_arr` will be assigned to the `Array` object 
`["hello", "hello", "hello"]`
