```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each_with_index do |num, index|
  puts "The index of #{num} is #{index}."
end
```

This code will output:

```
The index of 1 is 0.
The index of 2 is 1.
The index of 3 is 2.
```

And will return `[1, 2, 3]`

On `line 1` the `each_with_index` method is called on the `Array` object 
`[1, 2, 3]`. The `each_with_index` method is passed a `do..end` block with two
block parameters, `num` and `index`.

Inside of the block, the `puts` method is called and passed a `String` object as
an argument. The `String` object has the objects to which `num` and `index` are
assigned interpolated into it. For each iteration of the block, the resulting
`String` object is output and `nil` is returned. The return value of the block
is not used by the `each_with_index` method.

The `each_with_index` method returns the object on which it was called
