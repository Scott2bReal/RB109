```
def change_name(name)
  name = 'bob'
end

name = 'jim'
change_name(name)
puts name 
```

This code will output `jim` and will return `nil`

On `line 4`, local variable `name` is initialized and assigned to the `String`
object `'jim'`.

On `line 5` the `change_name` method is called and passed `name` as an argument.
The `change_name` method is defined on `lines 1-3` with one parameter `name`

Inside of the `change_name` method definition, the local variable `name` is
reassigned to the `String` object `'bob'`. Due to implicit return in Ruby, the
return value of the `change_name` method will always be `'bob'`

However, the return value is not used in this code. Therefore, when the `puts`
method is called on `line 7` and passed `name` as an argument, the local
variable `name` in the `main` scope is still assigned to the `String` object
`'jim'`. This is what is output, and as always, `puts` returns `nil`.
