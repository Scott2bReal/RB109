```ruby
hash = { a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }.any? do |key, value|
  value.size > 4
end

p hash
```

This code will output and return `false`

On `line 1` local variable `hash` is initialized and assigned to the return
value of the `any?` method being called on the `Hash` object
`{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }`. The `any?` method is passed a `do..end`
block with two block parameters, `key` and `value`.

Inside of the block, the `size` method is called on `value`. This method call
will return an `Integer` object. This will be used in the expression using the
`>` operator, which will compare that `Integer` object to the `Integer` object 4
and return a `boolean`. `any?` will use this `boolean` to determine its return
value. If at any point the block returns `true`, local variable `hash` will be
assigned to the `boolean` object `true`. If the block never outputs `true`, then
it will be assigned to `false`
