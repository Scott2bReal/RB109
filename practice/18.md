```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

new_array = arr.select do |n| 
  n + 1
end

p new_array
```

This code will output and return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

On `line 1`, local variable `arr` is initialized and assigned to the `Array`
object `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

On `line 3`, local variable `new_array` is initialized and asigned to the return
value of the `select` method being called on `arr`. `select` is passed a
`do..end` block with one block parameter `n`. The `select` method will execute
the block for each element of `arr`, and use the return value of the block to
populate a new `Array` object.

The expression inside of the block, `n + 1`, will in this case always return an
`Integer` object. Because the return value will never be `false` or `nil`,
every element of the calling `Array` object will be added to the new `Array`
object.

Therefore, on `line 7` when `p` is called and passed `new_array` as an argument,
the output and return will be as stated above
