```ruby
p [1, 2, 3].any? do |num|
  num > 2
end
```

This code will output and return `true`

On `line 1` the `p` method is called and passed the return value of the `any`
method being called on the `Array` object `[1, 2, 3]`. The `any?` method is
passed a `do..end` block as an argument with one block parameter, `num`

The `any?` method will use the return value of the block to determine its own
return value. If at any point the `do..end` block returns true, `any?` will
return true.

Therefore, because `3 > 2` returns `true`, `any?` will return `true`

The `p` method will output and return `true` because of this
