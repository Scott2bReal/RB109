```ruby
odd, even = [1, 2, 3].partition do |num|
  num.odd?
end

p odd 
p even
```

This code will output:

```
[1, 3]
[2]
```

and will return `[2]`

On `line 1` local variables `odd` and `even` are initialized and assigned via
parrallel assignment to the return values of the `partition` method being called
on the `Array` object `[1, 2, 3]`. The `partition` method is passed a `do..end`
block as an argument with one block parameter `num`.

The `partition` method will return two `Array` objects, the first of which will
be populated with all elements of the calling `Array` object for which the
`do..end` block returns `true`, and the other is populated with the elements for
which the `do..end` block returns `false`

Inside of the block, on `line 2`, the `odd?` method is called on `num`. `odd?`
will return a `boolean` value, `true` if the calling `Integer` object is odd and
`false` if it is not.

The `p` calls on `lines 5-6` will output the `Array` objects to which the local
variables passed as arguments to `p` are assigned. The `p` call on `line 6` is
responsible for the ultimate return value of the the code due to implicit return
in Ruby
returns `false`
