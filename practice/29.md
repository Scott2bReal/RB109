```ruby
{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }.all? do |key, value|
  value.length >= 3
end
```

This code has no output and will return `true`

On `line 1` the `all?` method is called on the `Hash` object
`{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }`. The `all?` method is passed a `do..end`
block with two block parameters, `key` and `value`.

Inside the block, on `line 2` the `length` method is called on local variable `value`. The
return value of this method call is used in the expression on `line 2`. It is
compared to the `Integer` object `3` using the `>=` operator. The return value
of this expression will be implicitly returned by the block as it is the last
evaluated expression in the block.

Because the expression on `line 2` will return `true` for every value in the
`Hash` object on which `all?` is called, the `all?` method will return `true`
