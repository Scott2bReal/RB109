```
a = %w(a b c)
a[1] = '-'
p a
```

This code will output and return the `Array` object `["a", "-", "c"]`

On `line 1` the local variable `a` is initialized and assigned to the `Array`
object `["a", "b", "c"]` using the `%w` shorthand.

On `line 2`, the `[]=` method is called on `a`, with the `Integer` object `1`
and the `String` object `'-'` passed in as arguments. The `[]=` method mutates
the caller.

On `line 3` the `p` method is called and passed `a` as an argument. This outputs
and returns `["a", "-", "c"]`
