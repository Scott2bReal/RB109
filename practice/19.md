```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

new_array = arr.select do |n| 
  n + 1
  puts n
end

p new_array
```

This code will output 

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

and return `[]`

In the body of the `do..end` block which is passed to the `select` method called
on `new_array` on `line 3`, on `line 4` the return value of the expression 
`n + 1` is never saved anywhere, so `n` continues to be assigned to the same
`Integer` object when the `puts` method is called with `n` passed as an argument
on the next line. 

`puts` will output the `Integer` assigned to `n` and will return `nil`. Because
`nil` is "falsey" in Ruby, `select` will not add any element of `arr` to the new
`Array` object it creates.

Therefore, when `p` is called and passed `new_array` as an argument, it will
output and return an empty `Array` object (`[]`)
