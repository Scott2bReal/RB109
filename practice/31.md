```ruby
hash =  { a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }

new_hash = hash.each_with_object([]) do |pair, array|
  array << pair.last
end

p hash
p new_hash
```

This code will output:

```
{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }
["ant", "bear", "cat]
```

and will return `["ant", "bear", "cat]`

On `line 1` local variable `hash` is initialized and assigned to the `Hash`
object `{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }`

On `line 3` the local variable `new_hash` is initialized and assigned to the
return value of the `each_with_object` method being called on `hash`. The
`each_with_object` method is passed an empty array (`[]`) and a `do..end` block
as arguments. The `do..end` block has two block parameters, `pair` and `array`.

The `each_with_object` method will iterate through a nested array created from
the key-value pairs present in the `Hash` object to which `hash` is assigned.
On each iteration the return value of the `last` method being called on the
`Array` object assigned to `pair` will be shoveled `<<` into the new `Array`
object created by `each_with_object`

The `p` method is called on `line 7` and passed `hash` as an argument.
`each_with_object` does not mutate the caller, so `hash` is still assigned to
the unchanged `Hash` object from `line 1`

The `p` method call on `line 8` with `new_hash` passed in as an argument will
output and return the `Array` object created by `each_with_object`
