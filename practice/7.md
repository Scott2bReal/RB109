```
def fix(value)
  value = value.upcase
  value.concat('!')
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)

p s
p t
```

This code will output:

```
"hello"
"HELLO!"
```

and return `"HELLO!"`

On `line 6` local variable `s` is initialized and assigned to the `String`
object `'hello'`.

On `line 7` local variable `t` is initialized and assigned to the return value
of the `fix` method being called and passed `s` as an argument. The `fix` method
is defined on `lines 1-4` with one parameter `value`

Inside of the the `fix` method definition, on `line 2`, the local variable
`value` is reassigned to the return value of the `upcase` method being called on
itself. This creates a new `String` object, `'HELLO'`

On `line 3`, the `concat` method is called on `value` and passed the `String`
object `"!"` as an argument. This mutates the caller, but because `value` is now
assigned to a different `String` object than the local variable `s` in the
`main` scope, the `String` object assigned to local variable `s` is unaffected.

The `fix` method call on `line 7` returns the `String` object `"HELLO!"`, which
is assigned to the local variable `t` on that same line

Therefore, the `p` call with `s` passed as an argument on `line 9` outputs and
returns the `String` object `"hello"`

The `p` call on `line 10` outputs and returns the `String` object `"HELLO!"`.
This is also the ultimate return value of the code
