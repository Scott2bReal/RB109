```
def increment(x)
  x << 'b'
end

y = 'a'
increment(y) 

puts y
```

This code will output `ab` and will return `nil`

On `line 5` local variable `y` is initialized and assigned to the `String`
object `"a"`.

On `line 6`, the `increment` method is called and passed `y` as an argument. The
`increment` method is defined on `lines 1-3` with one parameter `x`

In the definition of the `increment` method, the `String` object `'b'` is
shoveled (`<<`) into the object referenced by local variable `y`, in this case
the `String` object `'a'`. The `<<` operator mutates the caller, so the object
will be modified outside of the method definition.

Therefore, when the `puts` method is called on `line 8` and passed local
variable `y` as an argument, the `String` object assigned to `y` is `'ab'`. This
is output, and the return value of `puts` is always `nil`.
