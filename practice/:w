```
def fix(value)
  value = value.upcase!
  value.concat('!')
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)

p s
p t
```

This code will output:

```
"HELLO"
"HELLO!"
```

and return `"HELLO!"`

On `line 6` the local variable `s` is initialized and assigned to the `String`
object `'hello'`.

On `line 7` the local variable `t` is initialized and assigned to the return
value of the `fix` method being called with `s` passed in as an argument. The
`fix` method is defined on `lines 1-4` with one parameter, `value`

Inside of the `fix` method definition, on `line 2`, the local variable `value`
is reassigned using the `=` method to the return value of the `upcase!` method
being called on itself. 

On `line 3`, the `concat` method is called on `value` with a `String` object
`"!"` passed to it as an argument. At this point, `value` is now assigned to a
different `String` object than `s` is in the main scope, which means the
`String` object assigned to `s` is unaffected. Due to implicit return in Ruby,
this will be the return value of the `fix` method, and `t` will be assigned to
it in the `main` scope

Therefore, on `line 9` when the `p` method is called and passed `s` as an
argument, it will output and return `"HELLO"`

On `line 10`, when `p` is called and passed `t` as an argument, it will output
and return `"HELLO!"`. This will also be the return value of the code due to
implicit return in Ruby
