```
def a_method(string)
  string << ' world'
end

a = 'hello'
a_method(a)

p a
```

This code will output and return `"hello world"`

On `line 5` local variable `a` is initialized and assigned to the `String`
object `'hello'`

On `line 6` the `a_method` method is called and passed `a` as an argument.
`a_method` is defined on `lines 1-3` with one parameter, `string`

Inside of the `a_method` method definition, on `line 2`, the `String` object
`'world'` is shoveled (`<<`) into `string`. The shovel operater mutates the
caller, so the `String` object assigned to `a` in the `main` scope is affected

On `line 8`, the `p` method is called and passed in `a` as an argument. This
will output and return `"hello world"`.
