```
def add_name(arr, name)
  arr = arr + [name]
end

names = ['bob', 'kim']
add_name(names, 'jim')
puts names
```

This code will output:

```
bob
kim
```

and return `nil`

On `line 5` local variable `names` is initialized and assigned to the `Array`
object `['bob', 'kim']`

On `line 6` the `add_name` method is called and passed `names` and the `String`
object `'jim'` as arguments. The `add_name` method is defined on `lines 1-3`
with two parameters, `arr` and `name`

Inside of the `add_name` method definition, on `line 2`, local variable `arr` is
reassigned to the return value of the `Array#+` method being called on `arr`, with
`name` as an argument. The `Array#+` method does not mutate the caller, and instead
creates a new `Array` object. This means that the original `Array` object which
is still assigned to `names` in the `main` scope of the program is unaffected.

Therefore, on `line 7` when the `puts` method is called and passed `names` as an
argument, the output and return are as stated above
