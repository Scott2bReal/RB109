```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

new_arr = array.select do |num|
   puts num if num.odd?
end

p new_arr

```

This code will output:

```
1
3
5
```

and will return `[]` 

On `line 1` local variable `array` is initialized and assigned to the `Array`
object `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

On `line 3` local variable `new_arr` is initialized and assigned to the return
value of the `select` method being called on `array`. The `select` method is
passed a `do..end` block as an argument with one block parameter, `num`

In the body of this `do..end` block, the `puts` method is called and passed
`num` as an argument. An `if` modifier is added, so the `puts` method will only
execute if the call of `odd?` on `num` returns `true`

`select` uses the return value of the block to populate a new `Array` object
with the elements for which the block returns `true`. In this code, the block
will always return `nil` because either `puts` will be called, which returns
`nil`, or the `if` condition will not be met, which also returns `nil`
