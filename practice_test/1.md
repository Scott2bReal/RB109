```
pet = "dog"

loop do |pet|
  pet = "cat"
  break
end

puts pet
```


The code will output `"dog"` and return `nil` because on `line 1` the local
variable `pet` is assigned to the `String` object `"dog"`. When the `loop`
method is called on `line 3` it is passed a `do..end` block as an argument with
one parameter, `pet`. Inside the block, `pet` is assigned to the string object
`"cat"` on `line 4`, and on `line 5` the `break` keyword is used to exit the
loop. Because of the concept of variable shadowing, the local variable `pet`
initialized within the `main` scope is inaccessibile within the scope of the
`do..end` block on `lines 3-6`. Therefore, when the `puts` method is called on
`line 7`, `pet` is still pointing to the `String` object `"dog"`.
