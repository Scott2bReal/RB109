```
x = 'Sally'

[1, 2, 3].each do |x|
  x = 'Joe'
end

p x
```

This code will output `"Sally"` and return `"Sally"`.

Because the `each` method call on `line 3` is passed a `do..end` block with a
block parameter `x`, the concept of variable shadowing prevents access to the
local variable `x` initialzed and assigned to the `String` object `"Sally"` on
`line 1`. Therefore, the `p` method call on the final line of the program which
is passed as an argument `x` will provide the above stated return and output.
