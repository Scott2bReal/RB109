```
a = 'Bob'

5.times do |x|
  a = 'Bill'
end

p a
```

This code will output `"Bill"` and return the `String` object `"Bill"`

On `line 1` local variable `a` is assigned to the `String` object `"Bill"`

On `line 3`, the `times` method is called on the `Integer` object `5` and passed
a `do..end` block as an argument with one block parameter `x`.
  
On `line 4`, local variable `a` is reassigned to the `String` object `"Bill"`.
The local variable `a` is initialized in an outer scope, and is therefore
available for reassignment within the `do..end` block.

On `line 7`, the `p` method is called with `a` passed to it as an argument. This
outputs and returns the `String` object assigned to `a`: `"Bill"`
