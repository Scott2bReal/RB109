```
def change_word(str)
  str += '!!!'
  str.upcase!
end

word = 'hello'
change_word(word)
p word
```

This code outputs `"hello"` and returns the `String` object `"hello"`

On `line 6` local variable `word` is assigned to the `String` object `"hello"`.
On `line 7` the `change_word` method is called and passed `word` as an argument.
The `change_word` method is defined on `lines 1-4` with one parameter `str`. On
`line 2`, the `+=` shorthand for reassignment is used to reassign the value of
`str` from `"hello"` to `"hello!!!"`. On the following line, the `upcase!`
method is called on `str`. This does mutate the caller. This change is not
reflected in the ultimate return of the program however, because of the
reassignemnt in the previous line. `str` is now pointing to a new `String`
object, different from the object assigned to `word` in the outer scope.
Therefore, the return value of the `change_word` method call on `line 7` is not
used. The `p` method call on `line 8` will output and return the `String` object
`"hello"` as that is what `word` is assigned to.
