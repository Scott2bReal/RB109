```
pet = "dog"

loop do |animal|
  pet = "cat"
  break
end

puts pet
```

The code will output `"cat"` and will return `nil` because on `line 1` the local
variable `pet` is assigned the `String` object `dog`. In the `do..end` block
which is passed to the `loop` method on `line 3`, `pet` is assigned to the
`String` object `cat`. Because `pet` is initialized in an outer scope, it is
accessible within the scope of the `do..end` block, and is available for
reassignment. Therefore, on `line 8` when the `puts` method is called and passed
`pet` as an argument, the object `pet` is pointing to is the `String` object
`cat`. The `puts` method always returns `nil`
