```
def test
  puts "Preparing assessment"
end

var = test

if var
  puts "written assessment"
else
  puts "interview"
end
```

This code outputs:

`Preparing assessment`
`interview` 

and returns `nil`. 

On `line 5`, local variable
`var` is assigned to the return value of the `test` method. Because the return
value of the `puts` method call in the definition of `test` will always return
`nil`, this is what is assigned to local variable `var`. This is an example of
implicit return in Ruby, where the last evaluated expression in a method
definition or block is what is returned. 

In the conditional statement on `lines 7-11`, the `if var` statement will always
evaluate to `false`, because `var` will always be assigned to `nil`, which in
Ruby is falsey. Therefore, the `else` portion of the conditional will be
evaluated, outputting the `String` object `"interview"`. Again, the `puts`
method always returns `nil`, which will be the ultimate return value of the
code.
