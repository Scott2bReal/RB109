```
a = 1
b = 2

if a == true
  puts "Hallo!"
elsif b = false
  puts "Goodbye!"
else
  puts "No greeting for you!"
end
```

This code outputs `"No greeting for you!"` and returns `nil`

It returns `nil` because the return value of the `puts` method is always `nil`.
Its output is a result of the conditional statement on `lines 4-10`. On 
`line 3`, the expression `a == true` will evaluate to `false`, because although
local variable `a` is assigned to the `Integer` 1 on `line 1`, and that is a
"truthy" value, it is not `==` to `true`. On `line 6`, local variable `b` is
reassigned to `false`, which will return `false`, and this means the `elsif`
portion of the conditional statement will not be evaluated. This only leaves the
`else` on `line 7`, which will be evaluated and is ultimately responsible for
the output and return value of the code
