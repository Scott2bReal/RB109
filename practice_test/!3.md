```
def test(b)
  b.map {|letter| puts "I like the letter: #{letter}"}
end

a = ['a', 'b', 'c']

puts test(a)
```

This code returns `nil` and outputs the following:

```
I like the letter: a
I like the letter: b
I like the letter: c
```

On `lines 1-3` the method `test` is defined with one parameter `b`. On `line 5`
the local variable `a` is initialized and assigned the `Array` object 
`['a', 'b', 'c']`. When the `puts` method is called on `line 7` it is passed the
method `test`, which is in turn passed as an argument the object pointed to by
the local variable `a`. Because the `test` method is passed a reference to the
array object pointed to by `a`, that is the object that the `map` method is
called on inside of the `test` method definition. The `test` method returns an
array `[nil, nil, nil]` and outputs
