```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
counter = 0
sum = 0

loop do
  sum += arr[counter]
  counter += 1
  break if counter == arr.size
end 

puts "Your total is #{sum}"
```

This code will output `"Your total is 10"` and return `nil`

On `lines 1-3` local variables `arr`, `counter`, `sum` are initialzed and
assigned to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `0`, and `0`, respectively.

On `line 5` the `loop` method is called and passed a `do..end` block as an
argument.

On `line 6`, `sum` is reassigned to the sum of the value of the `Integer` object
to which it is currently assigned, and the value of the `Integer` object at the
index of the `Array` object assigned to `arr` equal to the value of the
`Integer` object assigned to `counter`, using the `+=` shorthand

On `line 7`, `counter` is incremented by `1` using the `+=` shorthand.

On `line 8` the `break` keyword used with an `if` modifier, which will exit the
loop if the `Integer` assignet to `counter` and the return value of the `size`
method called on `arr` are equal

On `line 11` the `puts` method is called and passed a `String` object as an
argument. It outputs that `String` object using string interpolation and the
value assigned to `sum`, and returns `nil`
