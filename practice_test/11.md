```
[[1, 2], [3, 4]].map { |arr| puts arr[0] }
```

This code will output:

```
1
3
```

and return an `Array` object `[nil, nil]`

The `map` method is called on the `Array` object `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`, and passed a
block as an argument, with one block parameter `arr`. `map` will iterate through
each element of the calling `Array`, calling the `puts` method with the return
value of `arr[0]` passed in as an argument. The `puts` method will output the
first element of each array, and will return `nil`. Because `map` uses the
return value of each iteration of the block to populate a new `Array`, that
array will only contain `nil` as that is always the return value of the `puts`
method.
