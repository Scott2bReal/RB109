```
def fix(value)
  value.concat('!')
  value = value.upcase
  value << 'xyz'
end
s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)

p t
```

This code outputs `"HELLO!xyz"` and returns the `String` object `"HELLO!xyz"`.

The method `fix` is defined on `lines 1-5`, with one parameter `value`. 
On `line 6`, local variable `s` is assigned to the `String` object `"hello"`. On
`line 7` we assign local variable `t` to the return value of `fix` with `s`
passed as an argument (in this case, s is pointing to the `String` object 
`"hello"`).  

Inside of the `test` method definition, the `concat` method is called on
`value`, which in this case is the `String` object `"hello"`. The 
`concat` method is passed the `String` object `'!'` as a variable. The `concat`
method mutates the calling object. Then, the
local variable `value` is reassigned on `line 3` to the return value of the
`upcase` method being called on `value`. Then on `line 4` the `String` object
`"xyz"` is shoveled into `value`. Because this is the last line of the method,
the `String` object assigned to `value` is returned.

On `line 9` of the program, the `p` method is called and passed the local
variable `t` as an argument. This outputs and returns the object that `t` is
pointing to.
